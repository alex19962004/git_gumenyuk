Dot Net C# is one of the greatest managed programming languages. A managed programming language interprets
or builds your code and transforms it into another executable format to be executed on your operating system.

For example, in .Net, when you write some code and try to build it, the Just-in-Time JIT compilation
compiles your code and transforms it to machine instructions, which then will be executed by Common
Language Runtime CLR. 

For more information about CLR, see Common Language Runtime.

In this post, we will discuss 6 different ways to insert a new line in C# and test our code on a console
application, and we will emphasize the relationship between one or more of these ways with what we
discussed earlier about CLR.

The 6 ways to insert new lines in C# are as follows:
Using parameter-less Console.WriteLine() to add a new line.
Injecting new lines within the same string.
Using Environment.NewLine.
Using the ASCII literal of a new line.
Using \r\n to insert a new line.
Inserting new lines in ASP.NET for an existing string.
